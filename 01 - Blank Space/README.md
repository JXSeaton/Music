This is the first song that I attempted to translate into a programming language. I chose a pop song because I wanted something that would be repetative and fairly simple. I chose Taylor Swift because I liked her music enough that I thought I would be able tolerate listening to the same song as many times as I knew it would take to disect and learn from the song.

I quickly realized that the song was not actually very repetitive. There are many melodies that are repeated except for changing a note or two. I found this difficult to account for when hoping to compose the song with a series of loops. I ultimately used the sheet music to structure the loops I did use.

I chose SonicPi for the programming language because it was the only music focused programming language I knew of at the time. Unfortunately, it was not up for the task. It is designed for live music that consists of loops. This (fairly simple) song is much two big for the program. Much of my programming time was spent creating functions to bypass the limitation of lines allowed instead of playing with and learning from music. I will not use SonicPi in the future.

### Lessons from this song:
- It honestly was not hard to listen to the song over and over again. I feared that I would end up hating the song. Because there are few enough songs that I inherently enjoy, this was a major concern for me. But familiarity with the song did not lessen the enjoyment. I found that a better appriciation for all the aspects of the song made me enjoy the song a little more. Which is my hope for this project.
- I was surprised to find out that SonicPi is not well suited for creating music.
- I did not add the drums to this piece. I was already at the limit of what i could do in SonicPi and my lack of familiarity with drums made the task too intimidating.
