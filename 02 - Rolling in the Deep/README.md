This is the song I made using Midica. The language seems more suited to my needs than SonicPi. There is less limitations on the size of the song and it has less of a focus on live music than SonicPi. The language uses music note and counts, which removes a lot of the more general programming setup that SonicPi requres too.

The programming of this song is shit! This is not to be used as an example of my programming ability. There are many inefficiencies as I taught myself the basics of the language by starting to write the song without planning the program first. The programs structure is solely based on the sheet music I used as a guide. 

The purpose of translating music via programming languages is for me to learn to better understand music via programming. This crappy program does serve as a good representation of my lack of deep understanding of music structure and patterns, and thus serves only as a starting line.

My goal is to use my insights in programming to better understand, and more importantly hear, the sturucture of a song and identify common patterns. Ultimately, I would like to translate the songs independently of any sheet music.

### Lessons from this song
- I need more experience with other instruments. The sheet music lacked many details of the music and I depended upon reading the music by ear for many parts. I found that it was relatively easy to do this for piano, which i have played as a child. However, I was lost when it came to guitar and had little to guide me for the drums. Basic theory in these instruments would be beneficial and a familiarity of their sounds apart from other instruments.
- More music theory would make my program more efficient. Midica allows the programmer to use the names of chords as a short hand notation (and i think the scale). Knowing these short hands would be greatly beneifical.
- Like all programming, the programmer greatly benefits from planning their code before writing it. Sheet music is not as efficient as the program could be, nor does it turn out to be a good guide for this type of composition. Before writing my next song I would greatly benefit from creating a flow diagram or basic psuedo code of the musical patterns before coding.
