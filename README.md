# Programming Music Project

I am pretty sure I have musical anhedonia. I have never been moved to tears by music, unless that song was associated with an upsetting event. I have also have never gotten shivers from a good song. I did not even suspect that was possible until I learned that people experience that a couple of years ago. I can like songs. Occasionally just listening to a song will make me a little happy or sad, but for the most part, music plays a very small part of my life. I would not miss it if music some how suddenly vanished.

I primarily tune it out if there is music playing in the background. But when I can't, music can cause me a lot of distress. It is often felt as an unwanted noise and unplesant distraction. Even songs I like, I have to be in the mood to listen to.

But, I suspect that it does not have to be this way. Music is just patterns, and my brain loves patterns. I suspect that if i could better understand music, and hear it for more than noise, I could unlock what others effortlessly find joyous. This is my attempt.

This idea came to me when describing how I feel about programming to someone. I likened it to how some people can just pick up an instrument and play it. That is how I learn to program. Pick up a language, play with it, and over time increase the sophisitication of the its use. Programming languages have their own feeling, or tone when programming in them. So, could programming languages be the key to unlocking music?

Perhaps my brain is too analytical and this is not the way to access music. To disect it down and mathematically describe it. But my quest is to train myself to find the patterns in music. Make better sense of the noise. And I don't think that is too far from the core of what most people do when they learn to appreciate different music. That is why some can hear genius in *Animals as Leaders* and other people just hear a wall of sound. 

If nothing else, hopefully this project gets me excited about discovering music.
