###Lessons Learned

- The song was fairly simple and it was the first time i had to edit down sheet music i found to better represent the music. Previously i was missing information.
- But this actually made things harder. Because it is a simpler song, it depends more heavily on small nuance in the vocals that i could not capture.
- This form of music is better suited to create technically complex music with less character... But I think good music should have character, so I don't know.
