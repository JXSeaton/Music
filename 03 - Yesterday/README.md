### Lessons learned

- Despite wanting to plan my music more and make it a better program, I still found this difficult. I don't really have a good understanding about how best to break up music. Many bars do repeat, but not so often that it seems efficient to make a function for a bar.
- I have been breaking up the song by bars and having all the instruments in a bar. I don't know if that makes the most sense. The patterns will sometimes repeat just for one instrument. I think that helps to simutaniously meet the brains desire to hear something familiar and predictable and to hear something unexpected.
- I thought this song would be easy because it seemed fairly simple and short... It has a string quartet, which should have been a clue that it is not as simple as i hoped. I think it will be a reaccuring theme that good music is generally more sophisticated than i seem to notice.
- It was very difficult to get sheet music for this song. None seems true to the original. The [string music that i did use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGGIz1BuMcA&t) added a lot more flourish than the original. I had a hard time determining how best to proceed. So i did limit the song to a trio.
